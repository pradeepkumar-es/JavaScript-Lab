/*
Promise: then versus catch
Are these code fragments equal? In other words, do they behave the same way in any circumstances, for any handler functions?

promise.then(f1).catch(f2);
Versus:

promise.then(f1, f2);
*/
//1st one will get error object from Promise return by .then, then this error will be handled by .catch, 
//but in 2nd one, there is no next .then/catch to handle error return by previous .then

/*
The short answer is: no, they are not equal:

The difference is that if an error happens in f1, then it is handled by .catch here:

promise
  .then(f1)
  .catch(f2);
…But not here:

promise
  .then(f1, f2);
That’s because an error is passed down the chain, and in the second code piece there’s no chain below f1.

In other words, .then passes results/errors to the next .then/catch. So in the first example, there’s a catch below, and in the second one there isn’t, so the error is unhandled.
